## How to make the backpack

* Purple/Yellow glow
  * Because I only need these 2 colors, I could use colored LED strings to cut down on cost/CPU/etc
* Healing Spray
  * Vape atomizer + aquarium air pump + high-lumen LEDs
* Damage Beam
  * aquarium air pump (other way == vacuum) + high-lumen LEDs
* Backpack
  * Thermo-set plastics

## Possible Issues

* Power
  * Atomizer draws ~2 Amps...will need dedicated power supply and heat might be an issue
    * Rig up test machine to check
